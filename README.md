Smart Cup Coaster
====
The aim of this project is to make a smart flashing cup coaster to remind me to drink more and be healthy.

It's just a short side project designed to practice making electronics as well as something just fun and useful.
I may make a variations, improvements and code changes over time or may leave it as it is.

I also wanted to use CLion more though you can likely compile this project using the base Arduino IDE.

If you have any questions about the project or any code feel free to join my discord https://discord.sekwah.com/
I am always looking to improve my skills so if you have any ideas on improvements software or hardware wise I would
love to hear them <3

# What is needed?
Just make sure you have PlatformIO installed https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html

Its quite a helpful library for making software on devices such as this.

Just a reminder that some esp32 boards if you cant upload to them you may need to hold down one of the buttons to start the flashing.
One example would be the HiLetgo ESP32.

Also change the port in platform.ini to whatever your device is connecting on if it isn't auto detected.

# Side note
If you are new to PlatformIO in clion check under `Tools > PlatformIO` for more tools and help.

Also if build targets are missing in CLion check [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/clion.html#known-issues) to manually add them.
